# Soundboard

This is the source code of Soundboard. Soundboard is an application that will play music to selected audio devices. You probably will not be able to compile this project because it depends on other packages and units, which are not included.

## Story

One day I was playing with friends and decided to do a little joke, but every single soundboard I downloaded would either be complicated or would require additional setup, so I decided to make my soundboard that could be fully controlled only using numpad, so that I would not be limited by about of shortcuts.

## Features

- Portable.
- Hotkeys are configurable.
- Resizable window height.
- Supports only WAV and MP3.
- Ability to select favorite sound.
- Save sound in memory.
- Loop sound.
- Import & Export playlist.
- Save playlist as a zip archive.

## Installation

This application doesn't require installation and is portable. The only thing you need to install is a virtual audio device, and configure it to play sound in a microphone. I used for it [VB-CABLE Virtual Audio Device](https://vb-audio.com/Cable/).
